While this journal consists of several required exercises, it is meant to encourage active reading more generally.  You should use this journal to take detailed notes, catalog questions, and explore the content from ThinkPython deeply.\n",

Music is one of my passions, and I arrange music for my acapella group. This article also resonates with me because I can see how this technology would be controversial. In an episode of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", one of the characters, a cyborg named Data, learned how to play the violin. One of the main themes was whether or not a cyborg could play as if he had emotion. The implication of this technology, that music can be mathematically manipulated, is pretty disturbing itself. It's not that this program takes the emotion out of music, but it seems to reveal that emotion was never truly present in the music. However, I would love to design a program that also write lyrics, to see if the \"cyborg composer\" would be able to capture the emotion conveyed through the lyrics of a song."

    "If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triangle. For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long and the other two are one inch long, it is clear that you will not be able to get the short sticks to meet in the middle. For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle:\n",
